# # Data Indexing and Selection

# In [Chapter 2](02.00-Introduction-to-NumPy.ipynb), we looked in detail at methods and tools to access, set, and modify values in NumPy arrays.
# These included indexing (e.g., ``arr[2, 1]``), slicing (e.g., ``arr[:, 1:5]``), masking (e.g., ``arr[arr > 0]``), fancy indexing (e.g., ``arr[0, [1, 5]]``), and combinations thereof (e.g., ``arr[:, [1, 5]]``).
# Here we'll look at similar means of accessing and modifying values in Pandas ``Series`` and ``DataFrame`` objects.
# If you have used the NumPy patterns, the corresponding patterns in Pandas will feel very familiar, though there are a few quirks to be aware of.
# 
# We'll start with the simple case of the one-dimensional ``Series`` object, and then move on to the more complicated two-dimesnional ``DataFrame`` object.

# ## Data Selection in Series
# 
# As we saw in the previous section, a ``Series`` object acts in many ways like a one-dimensional NumPy array, and in many ways like a standard Python dictionary.
# If we keep these two overlapping analogies in mind, it will help us to understand the patterns of data indexing and selection in these arrays.

# ### Series as dictionary
# 
# Like a dictionary, the ``Series`` object provides a mapping from a collection of keys to a collection of values:

# In[1]:


import pandas as pd
data = pd.Series([0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0],
                 index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])
data


# In[2]:


data['b']


# We can also use dictionary-like Python expressions and methods to examine the keys/indices and values:

# In[3]:


'a' in data


# In[4]:


data.keys()


# In[5]:


list(data.items())


# ``Series`` objects can even be modified with a dictionary-like syntax.
# Just as you can extend a dictionary by assigning to a new key, you can extend a ``Series`` by assigning to a new index value:

# In[6]:


data['e'] = 1.25
data


# This easy mutability of the objects is a convenient feature: under the hood, Pandas is making decisions about memory layout and data copying that might need to take place; the user generally does not need to worry about these issues.

# ### Series as one-dimensional array

# A ``Series`` builds on this dictionary-like interface and provides array-style item selection via the same basic mechanisms as NumPy arrays â€“ that is, *slices*, *masking*, and *fancy indexing*.
# Examples of these are as follows:

# In[7]:


# slicing by explicit index
data['a':'c']


# In[8]:


# slicing by implicit integer index
data[0:2]


# In[9]:


# masking
data[(data > 0.3) & (data < 0.8)]


# In[10]:


# fancy indexing
data[['a', 'e']]


# Among these, slicing may be the source of the most confusion.
# Notice that when slicing with an explicit index (i.e., ``data['a':'c']``), the final index is *included* in the slice, while when slicing with an implicit index (i.e., ``data[0:2]``), the final index is *excluded* from the slice.

# ### Indexers: loc, iloc, and ix
# 
# These slicing and indexing conventions can be a source of confusion.
# For example, if your ``Series`` has an explicit integer index, an indexing operation such as ``data[1]`` will use the explicit indices, while a slicing operation like ``data[1:3]`` will use the implicit Python-style index.

# In[11]:


data = pd.Series(['a', 'b', 'c'], index=[1, 3, 5])
data


# In[12]:


# explicit index when indexing
data[1]


# In[13]:


# implicit index when slicing
data[1:3]


# Because of this potential confusion in the case of integer indexes, Pandas provides some special *indexer* attributes that explicitly expose certain indexing schemes.
# These are not functional methods, but attributes that expose a particular slicing interface to the data in the ``Series``.
# 
# First, the ``loc`` attribute allows indexing and slicing that always references the explicit index:

# In[14]:


data.loc[1]


# In[15]:


data.loc[1:3]


# The ``iloc`` attribute allows indexing and slicing that always references the implicit Python-style index:

# In[16]:


data.iloc[1]


# In[17]:


data.iloc[1:3]


# A third indexing attribute, ``ix``, is a hybrid of the two, and for ``Series`` objects is equivalent to standard ``[]``-based indexing.
# The purpose of the ``ix`` indexer will become more apparent in the context of ``DataFrame`` objects, which we will discuss in a moment.
# 
# One guiding principle of Python code is that "explicit is better than implicit."
# The explicit nature of ``loc`` and ``iloc`` make them very useful in maintaining clean and readable code; especially in the case of integer indexes, I recommend using these both to make code easier to read and understand, and to prevent subtle bugs due to the mixed indexing/slicing convention.

# ## Data Selection in DataFrame
# 
# Recall that a ``DataFrame`` acts in many ways like a two-dimensional or structured array, and in other ways like a dictionary of ``Series`` structures sharing the same index.
# These analogies can be helpful to keep in mind as we explore data selection within this structure.

# ### DataFrame as a dictionary
# 
# The first analogy we will consider is the ``DataFrame`` as a dictionary of related ``Series`` objects.
# Let's return to our example of areas and populations of states:

# In[18]:


area = pd.Series({'California': 423967, 'Texas': 695662,
                  'New York': 141297, 'Florida': 170312,
                  'Illinois': 149995})
pop = pd.Series({'California': 38332521, 'Texas': 26448193,
                 'New York': 19651127, 'Florida': 19552860,
                 'Illinois': 12882135})
data = pd.DataFrame({'area':area, 'pop':pop})
data


# The individual ``Series`` that make up the columns of the ``DataFrame`` can be accessed via dictionary-style indexing of the column name:

# In[19]:


data['area']


# Equivalently, we can use attribute-style access with column names that are strings:

# In[20]:


data.area


# This attribute-style column access actually accesses the exact same object as the dictionary-style access:

# In[21]:


data.area is data['area']


# Though this is a useful shorthand, keep in mind that it does not work for all cases!
# For example, if the column names are not strings, or if the column names conflict with methods of the ``DataFrame``, this attribute-style access is not possible.
# For example, the ``DataFrame`` has a ``pop()`` method, so ``data.pop`` will point to this rather than the ``"pop"`` column:

# In[22]:


data.pop is data['pop']


# In particular, you should avoid the temptation to try column assignment via attribute (i.e., use ``data['pop'] = z`` rather than ``data.pop = z``).
# 
# Like with the ``Series`` objects discussed earlier, this dictionary-style syntax can also be used to modify the object, in this case adding a new column:

# In[23]:


data['density'] = data['pop'] / data['area']
data


# This shows a preview of the straightforward syntax of element-by-element arithmetic between ``Series`` objects; we'll dig into this further in [Operating on Data in Pandas](03.03-Operations-in-Pandas.ipynb).

# ### DataFrame as two-dimensional array
# 
# As mentioned previously, we can also view the ``DataFrame`` as an enhanced two-dimensional array.
# We can examine the raw underlying data array using the ``values`` attribute:

# In[24]:


data.values


# With this picture in mind, many familiar array-like observations can be done on the ``DataFrame`` itself.
# For example, we can transpose the full ``DataFrame`` to swap rows and columns:

# In[25]:


data.T


# When it comes to indexing of ``DataFrame`` objects, however, it is clear that the dictionary-style indexing of columns precludes our ability to simply treat it as a NumPy array.
# In particular, passing a single index to an array accesses a row:

# In[26]:


data.values[0]


# and passing a single "index" to a ``DataFrame`` accesses a column:

# In[27]:


data['area']


# Thus for array-style indexing, we need another convention.
# Here Pandas again uses the ``loc``, ``iloc``, and ``ix`` indexers mentioned earlier.
# Using the ``iloc`` indexer, we can index the underlying array as if it is a simple NumPy array (using the implicit Python-style index), but the ``DataFrame`` index and column labels are maintained in the result:

# In[28]:


data.iloc[:3, :2]


# Similarly, using the ``loc`` indexer we can index the underlying data in an array-like style but using the explicit index and column names:

# In[29]:


data.loc[:'Illinois', :'pop']


# The ``ix`` indexer allows a hybrid of these two approaches:

# In[30]:


data.ix[:3, :'pop']


# Keep in mind that for integer indices, the ``ix`` indexer is subject to the same potential sources of confusion as discussed for integer-indexed ``Series`` objects.
# 
# Any of the familiar NumPy-style data access patterns can be used within these indexers.
# For example, in the ``loc`` indexer we can combine masking and fancy indexing as in the following:

# In[31]:


data.loc[data.density > 100, ['pop', 'density']]


# Any of these indexing conventions may also be used to set or modify values; this is done in the standard way that you might be accustomed to from working with NumPy:

# In[32]:


data.iloc[0, 2] = 90
data


# To build up your fluency in Pandas data manipulation, I suggest spending some time with a simple ``DataFrame`` and exploring the types of indexing, slicing, masking, and fancy indexing that are allowed by these various indexing approaches.

# ### Additional indexing conventions
# 
# There are a couple extra indexing conventions that might seem at odds with the preceding discussion, but nevertheless can be very useful in practice.
# First, while *indexing* refers to columns, *slicing* refers to rows:

# In[33]:


data['Florida':'Illinois']


# Such slices can also refer to rows by number rather than by index:

# In[34]:


data[1:3]


# Similarly, direct masking operations are also interpreted row-wise rather than column-wise:

# In[35]:


data[data.density > 100]


# These two conventions are syntactically similar to those on a NumPy array, and while these may not precisely fit the mold of the Pandas conventions, they are nevertheless quite useful in practice.
