    "\n",
    "Quite a few hyperparameters have been introduced so far.  Tweaking each of these values can have an effect on the score obtained by your neural networks.  Some of the hyperparameters seen so far include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Number of layers in the neural network\n",
    "* How many neurons in each layer\n",
    "* What activation functions to use on each layer\n",
    "* Dropout percent on each layer\n",
    "* L1 and L2 values on each layer\n",
    "\n",
    "To try out each of these hyperparameters you will need to run train neural networks with multiple settings for each hyperparameter.  However, you may have noticed that neural networks often produce somewhat different results when trained multiple times.  This is because the neural networks start with random weights.  Because of this it is necessary to fit and evaluate a neural network times to ensure that one set of hyperparameters are actually better than another.  Bootstrapping can be an effective means of benchmarking (comparing) two sets of hyperparameters.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrapping is similar to cross-validation.  Both go through a number of cycles/folds providing validation and training sets.  However, bootstrapping can have an unlimited number of cycles.  Bootstrapping chooses a new train and validation split each cycle, with replacement.  The fact that each cycle is chosen with replacement means that, unlike cross validation, there will often be repeated rows selected between cycles.  If you run the bootstrap for enough cycles, there will be duplicate cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part we will use bootstrapping for hyperparameter benchmarking.  We will train a neural network for a specified number of splits (denoted by the SPLITS constant).  For these examples we use 100.  We will compare the average score at the end of the 100.  By the end of the cycles the mean score will have converged somewhat.  This ending score will be a much better basis of comparison than a single cross-validation.  Additionally, the average number of epochs will be tracked to give an idea of a possible optimal value.  Because the early stopping validation set is also used to evaluate the the neural network as well, it might be slightly inflated.  This is because we are both stopping and evaluating on the same sample.  However, we are using the scores only as relative measures to determine the superiority of one set of hyperparameters to another, so this slight inflation should not present too much of a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are benchmarking, we will display the amount of time taken for each cycle.  The following function can be used to nicely format a time span."
