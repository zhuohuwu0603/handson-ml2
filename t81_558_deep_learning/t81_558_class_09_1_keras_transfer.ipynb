    "Human beings learn new skills throughout their entire lives.  However, this learning is rarely from scratch.  No matter what task a human is learning, they are most likely drawing on experiences from earlier in life to learn this new skill.  In this way, humans learn much differently than most deep learning projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "At some point, a human being learns to tell the difference between a cat and a dog.  To teach a neural network the difference you would obtain a large quantity of cat pictures and dog pictures.  The neural network would iterate over all of these pictures and train on the differences.  The human child that learned to distinguish between the two animals would probably just need to see a few examples where they were told they were looking at each type of animal.  The human child would use previous knowledge of looking at different living and non-living objects to help make this classification.  The child would already know what sub-objects, such as fur, eyes, ears, noses, tails, and teeth looked like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transfer learning attempts to teach a neural network by similar means.  Rather than training your neural network from scratch, you begin training with preloaded set of weights. Usually you will simply remove the top-most layers of the pretrained neural network and retrain it with new topmost layers.  The layers remaining from the previous neural network will be locked so that training does not change these weights.  Only the newly added layers will be trained.  This process is summarized in the following figure.\n",

    "\n",
    "It can take a great deal of compute power to train a neural network for a large image dataset.  Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and other tech companies have utilized GPU arrays to train high quality neural networks for a variety of applications.  Transferring these weights into your neural network can save you considerable effort and compute time.  It is unlikely that a pretrained model will exactly fit the application that you seek to implement.  Finding the closest pretrained model and using transfer learning is an important skill for a deep learning engineer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [imagenet dataset]() has several high quality neural networks fit to it.  In the next parts of this module we will take a much closer look at this data set.  For many image recognition tasks, an imagenet trained neural network can be a great starting point for your own neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transfer Learning Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets look at an example of where transfer learning could be used to build upon an imagenet neural network.  Microsoft released a website that accepts a picture of a dog and attempts to classify these dogs by breed. The Microsoft dog breed website is provided here: \n",
    "\n",
    "[What breed is that dog?](https://www.bing.com/visualsearch/Microsoft/WhatDog)\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, it ie necessary to obtain pictures of dogs, labeled according to breed. Such a network could be trained entirely from scratch.  However, it would require a large quantity of breed-labeled pictures.  Transfer learning with imagenet could be very beneficial for a neural network project such as this.  A neural network pre-trained on imagenet would already contain neurons that are able to recognize many subcomponents of the various dog breeds that the neural network had previously seen on the other animal images in imagenet.\n",
